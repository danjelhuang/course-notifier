# Course Notifier

This project aims to help students get into classes they did not initally get into. When a spot opens up, this program will send an email notifying the student that they can enroll into their desired course. 

A similar tool that UW students use is signing up for notifications on UW Flow. However, it seems as though UW Flow's tool queries UW's API every few hours. This course notifier can notify students much quicker as it queries UW's API more frequently.
